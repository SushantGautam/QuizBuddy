<p>QuizBuddy is an opensource application to help the learners in learning
effectively with multiple-choice based examination approach that reports the
progress to users and lets the user review their quiz so that they can minimize the
mistakes on the next attempt. A sample quiz for secondary school graduates has been ues in the program for high school entrance preparation. It is a WIN 32 application that works natively on
Windows console, which lets the user take the quiz and learn effectively.
Further, it has remote database system which makes this program very dynamic.
The project database and the program itself can be updated from the internet. A
WIN API for downloading the data from internet has also been used. A unique
random quiz generator makes the application generate different sets of quiz each
time the user face. The program has quiz review function which lets users to find
out their mistakes in the last quiz. Along with it, there is a feature which displays
user progress in the graph.

interesting. It is a user friendly system which helps to visualize the result in an
interactive form and also allows the users to select different quiz database and
customize the number of questions for quiz.</p>
